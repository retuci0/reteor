# Reteor

Shittiest Meteor addon you'll find out there. Just took a 
bunch of missing features and pasted them into here.

### How to use

> To build:
- `git clone https://github.com/retuci0/reteor`
- `cd ./reteor/`
- `gradlew build`

> To use:
- Move the jar to your mods folder (probably `%appdata%/.minecraft/mods`)

### What it adds

- **AntiInvis:** Reveals invisible entities.
- **AnvilFont:** Lets you use special characters to imitate some font 
styles while renaming an item on an anvil.
- **AutoTorch:** Automatically uses torches when there is too little light.
- **BowKill:** Sends multiple movement packets per tick to make the next 
arrow you shoot deal a lot of damage.
- **Dolphin:** Makes you swim superfast, imitating a dolphin's movement.
- **EntityDesync:** Removes the entity you're riding client-side, hence desyncing 
what happens client-side and server-side.
- **EntityNametags:** Renders entities' nametag labels no matter whether you're 
hovering it or not. Idea by edlska.
- **FarThrow:** Makes you throw items way farther.
- **GhostMode:** Makes you a ghost by skipping the death screen and letting you 
move client-side.
- **HitboxDesync:** Desyncs you from your hitbox by moving slightly aside. Useful to 
avoid taking knockback.
- **IceSpeed:** Makes you move a lot faster in ice by changing its slipperiness. 
Very high and very low values will make you move superfast, while medium values 
will make you move slower.
- **JumpDelay:** Lets you customize the amount of jumping cooldown the player has.
- **PortalInvincibility:** Makes you unable to take damage while standing on portals 
by cancelling teleportation packets. Note that you won't be able to move or look around either.
- **Racist:** Uh it's not what it looks like I can explain...
